- Seamless integration with other aws services like, Redshift, EMR, Cognito, IAM, Cloudtrail, CloudWatch, S3, CloudSearch, Lambda, Data Pipeline etc.

**Advantages**

- Serverless
- Managed NoSQL database
- Scaling
  - On Demand
  - Auto
- Unlimited concurrent Read/Write
- Single digit mili second latency
- Suv microsecond lantency with caching (DAX)
- Very much cost effective
- Fault tolerant and secure
